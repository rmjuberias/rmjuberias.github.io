<h1>Main Research Interest</h1>
My main research interest is planetary atmospheric dynamics, particularly the dynamics of gas-giants, a large class that includes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Extra Solar Giant Planets, and Brown Dwarfs, and for which there are now extensive observations from ground-based telescopes and interplanetary spacecraft. Researching the atmospheres of different bodies in the Solar System in a comparative way is important because, due to their differences in mass, volume, rotation regimes, and energy balances, it gives us a broad critical understanding of how these systems work that could not be accomplished by studying the Earth alone. 

<h1>Opportunities for Students</h1>
Occasionally I have support for undergraduate and graduate students to do research. For more precise information about availability and topics please contact me in person or by email.
