My new web
=====================================

This is my custom Jekyll theme, which is basically [Joel Glovier](http://joelglovier.com/)'s `jekyll-new` modified

I use data-driven navigation, which you can see in the `menu.yml` file in the `_data` directory. There's also a `nav.html` file in the `_includes` directory with modified `header.html`.

Mobile support is clearly functional, though some white-spacing could be improved. Feel free to offer improvements if you'd like.

`css` and `_sass` directories also functional, if a bit cluttered.
